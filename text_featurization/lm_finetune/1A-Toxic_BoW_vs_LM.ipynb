    "# Featurizing Toxic Comments Using Pre-Trained Word Vectors and a Language Model's Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an analysis of featurization methods for text. The central idea we examine is that we can represent text (words, phrases, and even entire sentences or paragraphs) as vectors. However, we'll see that some vector representations may provide more semantic information than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-Trained Word Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first foray we featurize our data using publically available pre-trained word vectors. There are numerous word vectors available, the most common being [Word2Vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/), [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/), and [fasttext](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/). We'll use the **GloVe** vectors trained on Wikipedia and Gigaword 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our input dataset contains a variable sequence of tokens (words), which we vectorize into a list of real-valued vectors. In order to use a machine learning model with such a representation we need to transform it into a fixed-vector representation. We can do this by many different aggregation schemes: sum/mean, max, min, etc. For this notebook we simply utilize unweighted averages of all the tokens, but you'll likely find that for some applications it may be more useful to consider max/min in addition, and concatenate multiple representations.\n",

    "## Language Model Encoders\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll then examine a more advanced method of featurizing our sequence of tokens. In particular, we'll use the encoder from a pre-trained language model. The encoder is a fixed-length vector representation that is typically the last hidden vector in a recurrent neural network trained for machine translation or language modeling.\n",

    "The class is a bit verbose for readability, but it's conceptually very simple. We load the pre-trained module, which defines a static computational graph with the learned weights from the language model on it's dataset. We initialize this computational graph into a Keras session, which we can then use for fine-tuning or for featurizing an input sequence by computing a forward pass of the computational graph. Note, we could have also just used `tensorflow` directly to do the model building and training, but Keras has some helpful utilities for data min-batching and pre-fetching that makes this very easy (at the cost of some incompatibilities: [issues with fine-tuning may arise](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!topic/hub/Y4AdAM7HpX0)."

    "The encoder features outperform the bag-of-words (BoW) glove vectors at every level of training data experience. While a more careful aggregation procedure of the word vectors would have done much better (in fact, there's good evidence that a thoughtful weighted-average can be [very hard to beat](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyK00v5xx) on many discriminative tasks), the main point of this analysis is that using pre-trained encoders can basically be a drop-in replacement for word vectors for many applications and give significant gains, _modulo_ additional computation time to featurize the dataset (the BoW approach uses a lookup to compute features, which is very fast, whereas the encoder approach requires a full forward pass through a complicated recurrent neural network, which are inherently sequential (this is why there is a greater push towards [feed-forward architectures for language modeling](https://blog.openai.com/language-unsupervised/), which can be much faster during training and evaluation time)."

    "It's unfortunately pretty challenging to find any civil discussion on online forums. In the example highlighted above our BoW approach predicted the comment to be an attack, whereas the encoder correctly predicted it as benign. The prevalence of terms such \"dumb\", \"sorry\" _bias_ the average word vector to a representation that is more likely to be an attack than a nice comment, whereas the language model is able to encode the sequence of representations more accurately. A more acute example of this phenomena arises with swear words (ommitted here, but see for example record index `[105512]` for an example where the single occurrence of a curse word causes the BoW classifier to misclassify the sentiment dramatically (but the encoder gets it right). This also arises frequently in the use of **negation** in sentiment analysis."
